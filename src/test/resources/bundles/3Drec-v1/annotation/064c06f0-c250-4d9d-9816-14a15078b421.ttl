<../workflow/Workflow1/processor/3DReconstructionApplication/> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> """Experimental MPI application running on cluster, providing some video semantic analysis, while saving details about cluster environment (like memory usage, available drivers, names of currently used nodes, processing time, etc.) to XML metadata.
The experimental applications will be applications for 
1) Reconstruction of 3D model from set of images, there will be cca. 270000 images from stereo camera, we will divide them to smaller groups and reconstruct smaller model from each group of images.
2) Anotation of mountain scenery images - we try to align real images to synthetically rendered panoramas (from high resolution DEM) while varying some parametrs (sampling, resolution etc.). Dataset will contain text and jpeg images and some text files (maybe in XML format), this data set will not be large-scale, but the metadata coming from the experiment will be large scale (we will run the application on the same data for many times with many different values of parameters).""" .
